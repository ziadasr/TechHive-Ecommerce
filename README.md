## üöÄ Getting Started: Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

You must have the following installed locally:

- **Node.js** (v18.x or higher)
- **PostgreSQL** (running locally or accessible via network)
- **npm** or **Yarn**

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/TechHive-Ecommerce.git](https://github.com/your-username/TechHive-Ecommerce.git)
    cd TechHive-Ecommerce
    ```

2.  **Database & Backend Setup**

    - Create a new PostgreSQL database (e.g., `techhive_db`).
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    - Install dependencies, then run database migrations and seeding (if applicable):

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install

    ```

3.  **Environment Variables**

    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder based on the provided `.env.example`. This file requires your database credentials and email service (SMTP) details.

4.  **Frontend Setup**

    - Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend or in the root directory
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Start the Servers**
    - In one terminal, start the backend:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```
    - In a second terminal, start the frontend:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

## üé¨ Usage

The frontend application will typically open in your browser at **`http://localhost:3000`** (or another port specified by your frontend framework).

1.  **Initial Access:** Navigate to the URL and register a new user account.
2.  **Email Verification:** Check your email (or logs if using a development SMTP service like Mailtrap) to verify your account.
3.  **Start Shopping:** Log in, browse the product catalog, add items to your cart, and place a test order.
4.  **Admin View:** Access the admin dashboard (usually at `/admin` route) to manage the orders you just created.

5.  **to use the admin features** use the hardcoded function in admins controller to regester the admin into your new database
